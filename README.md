# Blackboard Downloader GUI  
## Description  
A GUI programme that batch downloads files from courses on CUHK's Blackboard platform, so that you don't have to manually click on each file in a browser to download them.  
Only works for CUHK's Blackboard platform.  

## Setup
Supported platform: Tested on Windows 10 with JDK 17.0.8 and JRE 1.8    
May or may not work on other OS that support Java  

1. Install a Java Runtime Environment  
   You'll need a JRE equivalent to or newer than Java 8
   You can install the official one from Oracle
   https://www.java.com/en/download/


1. Download a compiled jar executable from [Releases](https://github.com/steveglowplunk/Blackboard-Downloader-GUI/releases).  

## Usage  

1. Login to your CUHK Blackboard account through a broswer, such as Firefox or Chrome  

1. Use a browser extension to export a (Netscape format) cookies file, in txt format  
	- If you're using Firefox, use this extension:  
	"Export Cookies" by Rotem Dan  
	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/  
	For example:  
	![firefox_2023_08_08_110851](https://github.com/steveglowplunk/Blackboard-Downloader-GUI/assets/28670916/827e229d-1fb1-4c6b-8f33-3f33b5c21cf8)

	- If you're using Chrome, use this extension:  
	"Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" by kairi003  
	https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc  
	For example:  
	![chrome_2023_08_08_110954](https://github.com/steveglowplunk/Blackboard-Downloader-GUI/assets/28670916/50ee50cd-c5ee-4183-b4f6-b35cb1cb10d8)

	- But what is a cookie?  
	Think of it as a temporary key that allows login without entering an account and password.  
	The cookies from Blackboard expire every few hours so you'll need to re-export your cookies when they are expired.  
	
1. Simply double click on Blackboard-Downloader-GUI.jar to open the application  

1. 	Click "Load Cookies File" and choose the cookies txt file exported by your browser earlier. You should see a simlar screen:
